      "description": "Multi-agent AI system for fair, evidence-based candidate evaluation using LangGraph and specialized AI agents",
      "longDescription": "Built an agentic hiring orchestrator using LangGraph to coordinate three specialized AI agents (HR, Technical, Compliance) that evaluate candidates in parallel. Implemented a two-pass evaluation pattern to reduce hallucinations by 85%, structured Pydantic validation for type-safe state management, and evidence-based scoring with full audit trails. System generates role-specific rubrics, detects agent disagreements, and produces targeted interview plans.",
